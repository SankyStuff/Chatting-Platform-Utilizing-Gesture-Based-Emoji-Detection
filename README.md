# Project Title
Chatting Platform Utilizing Gesture Based Emoji Detection

## Abstract

Every aspect of human life is slowly getting computerized and gradually turning electronic. This has made a range
of tasks a lot easier and accessible for people from all walks
of life. Unfortunately, this rapid computerization and the ever
changing landscape of electronics has given birth to a new class
of computer - illiterate individuals. Such individuals exist due to
the lack of accessibility to latest electronic gadgets, or humansocial problems like old age. There is a need to make technology
fun and easier to use for individuals belonging to such classes.
The very primary use of internet-based networking is text-based
communications namely: e-mails, texts chats, blogs, etc. The text
based interaction is mainly facilitated using a keyboard which
makes it the most focal human-computer interaction involved.
The modern usage of this text-based communication involves
extensive usage of emoticons. While most handheld devices
feature a customised emoji-keyboard, the emoji keyboard is
difficult to access in personal computers. This can adversely affect
the interactions the aforementioned computer-illiterates partake
in. This project aims to deal with this problem by creating
a hand-detection based emoji detection algorithm in python
through OpenCV and Mediapipe for detection of hand landmarks
and implementing it in one such communication channel. The
algorithm consists of two modules: a Hand-Tracking Module
and an emoji detector capable of matching the tracked hand to
existing emoji database. The resulting application is consistent,
allow frequent users to use shortcuts and make the user feel more
in control. We also strive to have error prevention and simple
error handling in existing emoji detection technologies along with
managing short term memory load.
